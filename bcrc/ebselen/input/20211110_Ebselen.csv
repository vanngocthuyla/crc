Substrate peaks were integrated for + 2 charge states as opposed to +1 charge state as per the assay protocol. + charge state of substrate was no longer present due to high amount of enzyme used.
Concentration of protein given was 3.4-fold off, hence increasing the enzyme concentration above assay condition of 150 nM.
From my previous experience, less potent compound will seem have apparent lower IC50 when analyzed with +2 charge state of substrate vs +1, however the IC50 of ebselen was similar with both charge state of substrate extraction in RapidFire Integrator.",87.67,87.95,87.74,87.88,87.92,88.29,88.44,88.7,88.22,88.55,89.74,88.87,88.71,88.02,88.71,88.95,88.99,88.78,89.25,89.52,88.33,89.7
